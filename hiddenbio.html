                        My name is Jashan Ahuja. I was born to parents from Nebraska (my mother) and India (my father) in London some 20 something years ago. I enjoyed my childhood, and traveled every summer to Nebraska to see my extended family on my mum's side. In small-town Nebraska I had freedom and security, and learned to ride my bike, swim, bake homemade rolls, and enjoy the great plains. At heart I am a country boy.

                        My education was that of an old English school in a London suburb up until the age of 18. But I've never quite done things by-the-book, and after high school I left the UK to study at Cornell, in Upstate NY. I learned a lot and made great friends, and during my time there I re-founded a fraternity, which serves as my most enduring connection to the institution. I return whenever I get the chance. After college I moved to Boston for a job, and a few years later I met my lovely wife, Katrina. Since then our adventures have been tied together as one, and we have lived in New York City, and then Portsmouth, so far. I'm looking forward to using my web development skills in my future endeavors.
